    post: [
      "On June 21, we had the joy of taking part in the Winter Solstice Festival at Pocket City Farms — and what a magical day it was!",
      "We set up our little Tatacookies stall filled with handmade gingerbread cookies and custom decorated treats, bundled up against the winter chill, and soaked in the festive atmosphere all around us. The farm was glowing with warmth — from live music and delicious local food to laughter and twinkling lights.",
      "My sons were there to help throughout the day — from setting up our stall of artisan cookies to proudly sharing our creations with visitors. Having them by my side made it all even more special. And to top it off, we got to reconnect with some old friends and meet so many kind new faces who were curious about our personalised cookies handmade in Sydney.",
      "It was a beautiful reminder of why I started Tatacookies — to bring a little sweetness and joy to our community in Wollstonecraft and beyond.",
      "Thank you to everyone who stopped by and supported our small Sydney-based cookie business. Your smiles and kind words warm even the coldest winter day.",

      "How FoodLab Helped Me Turn a Passion Into a Business — and Build a New Life",
    post: [
      "Starting over in a new country isn’t easy. When I arrived in Australia, I brought with me a deep love for baking — especially creating handmade gingerbread cookies and custom decorated treats. But turning that passion into a real business felt overwhelming. I didn’t know where to begin, especially with all the challenges of immigration and building a life from scratch in Sydney.",
      "That’s when I discovered the FoodLab Program — and everything changed.",
      "FoodLab didn’t just give me knowledge. They gave me the skills, structure, and confidence I needed to start a small baking business in Sydney. I learned how to build a food business legally and sustainably, including navigating the specific requirements tied to my immigration journey. From business registrations and food certifications to marketing, pricing, and developing my range of artisan cookies and handmade gingerbread, they supported me every step of the way.",
      "With their help, I officially launched Tatacookies, my Sydney-based handmade cookie business. What began as a hobby in my home kitchen in Wollstonecraft has grown into a small business I’m proud of — one that offers personalised cookies for birthdays, weddings, and special occasions across Sydney.",
      "I’m incredibly grateful for this journey — and for FoodLab’s belief in me, even when I doubted myself. Today, Tatacookies isn’t just about cookies; it’s about sharing a little sweetness and joy with the Sydney community and building a new life for my family.",
